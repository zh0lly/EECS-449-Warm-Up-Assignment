Explain what the state represents and how it can be used in the chatbot.:
I think my users might get a bit frustrated using my bot, because I was only able to run the really small and crappy models on my computer. So, I added an emotional support state for emotional support related requests, so the chatbot can also console the user. The state represents a frustrated query or request for emotional consolation.

Explain how the chatbot will route the user query to your custom chat model based on the classification.
The request first gets classified by the llm, and then this classification is used to give the chatbot a prompt that targets a certain purpose, such as giving context documents or consoling an unsatisfied user.
